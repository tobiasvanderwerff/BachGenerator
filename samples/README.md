## Samples
Some random output samples from the LSTM. The model can produce some pretty cool 'music' now and then, although a common pattern is that it is generally incapable of maintaining a long-term, coherent musical idea. It's more like it is constanly improvizing new stuff without much regard for what came before it. 

Note that the LSTM can indefinitely sample new notes, so it never really 'finishes' any of its music. I essentially chose a random point at which to end the sampling, so the endings of most of the samples can feel pretty abrupt.

For samples 5, 6 and 7, I fed the model the first 7 seconds of 'Contrapunctus I' from Bach's Art of Fugue, and let it generate notes based on that. Samples 1, 2, 3 and 4 are not given any 'warm-up' input.

Here are some of my personal highlights:
- sample1: 1:58 - 2:40
- sample2: 3:39 - 4:14
